## Thoughts

I did well in general with this project it took 5-6 hours to complete and was fun. I learnt a lot about inputs besides buttons and interacting from javascript to css. I found css to be quite difficult nothing in particular but it would not do what I wanted or thought it should do most of the time. I found the color interaction particularly confusing. I thought if I set the color of a cell to #fff it would output #fff when I try and read it, but it gave me rgb(255, 255, 255) instead. This was fine but weird. I didn't encounter many other significant problems.
